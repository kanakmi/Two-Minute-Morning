# Two-Minute-Morning

A Journal to Win Your Day Every Day

## 💡 Inspiration

## 💻 What it does

## ⚙️ How we built it

- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JS
- Backend: Django
- Linode: hosting and storage
- Twilio: Sending email and SMS

## ☁️ Use of Linode

We have a dedicated Linode server for our backend. We use it for hosting our website and for storing our data. Linode Block Storage allows users to extend their server storage capacity with volumes on demand. Linode Backup allows us to back up their servers on a daily, weekly, or monthly basis which makes it easy and efficient. Linode allows users to manage multiple server instances across a single system.

## 📧 Use of Twilio

We used Twilio to send emails to our users as a reminder to complete the tasks and send early morning Whatsapp messages. Twilio allows us to programmatically make and receive phone calls, send and receive text messages, and perform other communication functions using its web service APIs.
